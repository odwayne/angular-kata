# angular-kata - library of reusable modules to AngularJS apps

This project is an library of components for a [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use any of theses components in your projects just by adding their modules to your main app module.

All modules in kata are very well tested and bug free, they are ready to pick and use in you project.


## Philosophy

### Lightweight, Easy to use modules..

Kata aims to providing a set of AngularJS reusable modules. The goal is to provide native AngularJS directives without any dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript. It is often better to rewrite an existing JavaScript code and create a new, pure AngularJS directive. Most of the time the resulting directive is smaller as compared to the orginal JavaScript code size and better integrated into the AngularJS ecosystem.

Many code design ideas came from the [awesome project angular-ui bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap), thank you guys!

### Take what you need and not more

There are bunch of different modules inside the project without third-party dependencies. In pratice it mes that you can just grab any module you want insted of the whole package.

### Quality and stability

The modules should work. All the time and in all browsers. This is why they all have a comprehensive suite of unit tests. All the automated tests are executed on each checkin in several browsers: Chrome, ChromeCanary, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9.The testing infrastructure is the same as in the AngularJS!
